# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build Commands

All builds target the `workspace/` directory as the CMake source root.

```bash
# Full workspace build (Release)
cmake -B build -S workspace -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)

# Debug build
cmake -B build-debug -S workspace -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

# Single module build (e.g., pid)
cmake -B build-pid -S workspace/robotics/control/pid

# Run all tests
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure

# Run a single test binary (after build)
./build/robotics/control/pid/tests/pid_tests

# Format code (run from workspace/)
clang-format -i <file>
```

**Dependencies** are all managed via CMake FetchContent — no vcpkg or Conan needed. See [workspace/cmake/deps.cmake](workspace/cmake/deps.cmake) for the full list.

**Docker dev environment:**
```bash
cd docker
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
docker exec -it TheRobotLibrary bash
```

## Architecture

TheRobotLibrary is a modular C++ robotics library with three strictly separated tiers:

### Tier 1: Robotics Modules (`workspace/robotics/`)
Self-contained, reusable C++ libraries. Modules may only depend on `common` — never on each other, simulation, or frontends. Domains: `common`, `control`, `perception`, `state_estimation`, `motion_planning`, `fleet_management`.

### Tier 2: Simulation Backend (`workspace/simulation/`)
A standalone Crow (HTTP + WebSocket) server. Maintains world state, runs a 50 Hz sim loop, streams state at 30 Hz. May link against robotics modules. REST API at `http://host:8080/api/*`, WebSocket at `ws://host:8080/state`.

### Tier 3: Frontends (`workspace/frontends/`)
- **Native:** C++ desktop app (ImGui + SDL2 + OpenGL)
- **Web:** TypeScript/React with HTML5 Canvas

**Frontends NEVER link against simulation or robotics libraries.** All communication is network-only via WebSocket + REST.

### Dependency Rule
```
Robotics modules → only depend on common
Simulation       → may depend on robotics modules
Frontends        → network API only (no library links)
```
### Workflow
- Use superpower workflow: Brainstorm → plan → execute → review for all new features, modules, and milestones.
- During brainstorm, when asking questions always have a recommended answer ready to guide the response and why that is recommended (don't leave it open-ended).

## Module Template

Every module follows this layout:
```
<module>/
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── README.md
├── include/<module>/   # public headers only
├── src/                # implementation files
├── tests/              # Catch2 unit tests + CMakeLists.txt
└── docs/
    └── theory.md       # math/algorithm explanation
```

Each module produces a CMake `STATIC` or `INTERFACE` target named `<module>` with alias `robotlib::<module>`. Tests are conditionally included: `if(BUILD_TESTING AND EXISTS tests/CMakeLists.txt)`.

## Code Conventions

From [workspace/architecture.md](workspace/architecture.md):

| Element | Convention |
|---------|-----------|
| Files/directories | `snake_case` |
| Types (classes, structs, enums) | `PascalCase` |
| Methods/functions | `camelCase` |
| Member variables | `m_camelCase` |
| Constants/macros | `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` |

- **C++ standard:** C++20 minimum — use `std::ranges`, `std::span`, `std::optional`, `std::expected`
- **Memory:** No raw owning pointers — use `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, or value types
- **Error handling:** `std::expected<T, E>` for recoverable errors; exceptions only for programmer errors
- **Testing:** Catch2 v3 (`TEST_CASE`, `REQUIRE`, `CHECK`)

## Observability Gate

All modules must use `common/logging/` (`ILogger` + `SpdlogLogger`) before being considered complete. This is the "Phase 4.5" gate in the milestone checklist.
