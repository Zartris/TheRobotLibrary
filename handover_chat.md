# Session Chat Summary — March 13, 2026

## 1. Conversation Overview

**Primary Objectives:**
- Read and understand the prior handover context ✅
- Deep investigation of all milestone/module planning docs ✅
- Execute 3 new items from `repo-plans/todos.md` using brainstorm→plan→execute→review workflow ✅ ALL DONE

**Three todos processed:**
1. **Fleet management scaffold + M12 milestone** — VDA 5050, task assignment, fleet monitoring, battery management
2. **Advanced control algorithms + M11 milestone** — Adaptive Control, Control Barrier Functions, Frenet-Serret controller
3. **Agent/Developer Observability** — everything observable via logging/metrics; added to all milestones as exit criterion

**Session Context:**
All prior planning docs (M0–M10) were complete. This session added 3 new module clusters, 2 new milestones (M11, M12), the observability framework (`common/logging/`), and updated every milestone with an observability exit criterion. A `superpower-brainstorm` design doc was produced, then the execute phase ran directly from its decisions (plan agent returned no response). A `superpower-review` agent reviewed all changes, found 8 issues (2 critical, 6 minor); all 8 were resolved.

## 2. Technical Foundation

- **Project root:** `/home/zartris/code/cpp/TheRobotLibrary/workspace/` — C++20 robotics library, zero source code
- **Build system:** CMake 3.20+, FetchContent, 40+ CMakeLists.txt scaffold files
- **Dependencies (deps.cmake):** Eigen 3.4, Catch2 v3.5.2, nlohmann_json v3.11.3, Crow v1.2, OSQP v0.6.3, cpp-httplib v0.15.3, IXWebSocket v11.4.4, SDL2, ImGui v1.90.4; acados + g2o commented out
- **Swappable interface architecture** — 6 abstract interfaces in `common/`:
  - `IController`, `IGlobalPlanner`, `ILocalPlanner`, `IStateEstimator`, `IVelocityProfiler`, `IKinematicModel`, `ISlamEstimator`
- **REST API for module hot-swapping:** `PUT /api/robot/controller`, `/global_planner`, `/kinematics`, etc.
- **Robot kinematics:** `IKinematicModel` in `common/kinematics/`; DifferentialDrive, AckermannModel, UniCycleModel, SwerveDrive
- **Common map:** `OccupancyGrid` and `Map` types in `common/`, shared by all modules
- **MPC solver:** acados (real-time NMPC); OCP via CasADi → generated C code
- **Observability standard (NEW):** `ILogger` in `common/logging/`; `SpdlogLogger` default impl; format `[LEVEL][MODULE] message key=value`; every module must pass Phase 4.5 gate before exit
- **CBF (NEW):** `CbfSafetyFilter : IController` decorator; Eigen QP (no external solver); safety set `h(x) = ‖p_r − p_obs‖² − r_safe²`
- **VDA 5050 (NEW):** nlohmann/json serialization of all 5 message types (Order, InstantAction, State, Connection, Visualization)
- **Fleet sub-module dep order:** vda5050 → fleet_monitor → task_allocation + battery_management

## 4. Review Findings — Final Status

**superpower-review ran after execute phase; all 8 findings resolved.**

### Critical (BOTH FIXED ✅)
1. `common/logging/` missing on disk — **Created** full scaffold (CMakeLists.txt, README.md, docs/theory.md); wired into common CMakeLists.txt
2. M0 missing observability exit criterion — **Added** criterion #7 to M0 exit criteria

### Minor (ALL 6 FIXED ✅)
3. vda5050 CMakeLists.txt test guard — Already present (false positive)
4. Architecture dep graph missing `fleet_management` — Added `common ← fleet_management`
5. M11 scope heading listed CBF as one of 3 algorithms — Fixed to "Two new control algorithms… CBF was delivered in M3"
6. Fleet sub-modules missing `docs/theory.md` — Created all 4 theory docs
7. fleet_monitor/task_allocation/battery_management missing vda5050 dep — Fixed CMakeLists.txt for all 3; added fleet_monitor dep where needed; fixed sub-module processing order
8. M11 duplicate header path — Fixed to use distinct `adaptive_pid_config.hpp`

---

## 5. Prior Session History (Phases 1–4)

### Phase 1: Full Project Scaffold
- Complete project structure under `workspace/`
- 33 documentation files: README.md, architecture.md, all sub-module READMEs and theory.md

### Phase 2: CMakeLists.txt Scaffolding
- `workspace/cmake/deps.cmake` with FetchContent for all dependencies
- 38 CMakeLists.txt files across entire project

### Phase 3: Milestone Planning
- Brainstorm → plan → execute → review workflow
- Created all milestone docs (M0-M10), 11 per-module task files
- Review found 16 issues (3 critical, 7 important, 6 minor) — all fixed

### Phase 4: Review Fix + Architectural Decisions
- All 16 review findings fixed
- 4 new architectural decisions integrated:
  1. Swappable robot kinematics (`IKinematicModel` in `common/kinematics/`)
  2. Common map representation (`OccupancyGrid`, `Map` in `common/`)
  3. Camera-based SLAM — projective landmark or 2.5D raycaster options (decide in M6)
  4. MPC framework — acados chosen (CasADi for OCP spec)

### Phase 5: Todos Execution (this session)
- 3 todos from `repo-plans/todos.md` processed via brainstorm→execute→review
- Brainstorm design doc produced at `.github/superpower/brainstorm/2026-03-13-robot-library-expansions-design.md`
- 25 new scaffold files created; 15+ planning docs updated
- Review found 8 issues; all 8 resolved

---

## 6. Active Work State

**Current Status:** All planning complete. All milestone docs, module task files, scaffold files, and architectural decisions are finalized. `repo-plans/todos.md` is empty of pending items.

**Dependency graph summary:**
```
M0 → M1 → M2 → M3 → M11
               M4 → M6 ← M5
               M7 ← M4
               M8 ← M3 + M7 → M12
               M9
               M10 ← M8 + M9
```

**Ready for:** M0 execution (dev infrastructure) → M1 implementation (minimum viable robot).

---

## 7. Next Steps

1. **Start M0** — AI agent instructions (`.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`), devcontainer, CI/CD, clang-format/tidy, pre-commit, fleet_management + logging scaffold verification
2. **Start M1** — minimum viable robot, following M1-A through M1-L sub-phases in order
3. Begin with `repo-plans/modules/common.md` tasks (M1-A) as the foundation for all other modules
4. When implementing any module, follow `repo-plans/module-task-template.md` — **Phase 4.5 (Observability) is mandatory** before marking a module complete
